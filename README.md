# Menu

The purpose of the project is to provide a menu using plain JavaScript, without using any frameworks.  However, Google Fonts will be used.

## UX

This project is a menu of the things I usually have for breakfast, lunch and desserts.

As a user, I expect all the items to be displayed when the page loads.

As a user, when I hover over the buttons, the background and foreground color changes.

As a user, I can select all items, breakfast items, lunch items or dessert items.

## Information Architecture

An object array, menu consists of:

    id          - Number
    title       - String
    category    - String
    price       - Number
    img         - String
    desc        - String

The title is the name of the item.  The category is breakfast, lunch and desserts.

The img is the filename of the image.
The desc is the description of the item.  It can include cooking methods (e.g. hob) and availability (e.g. Tesco).
